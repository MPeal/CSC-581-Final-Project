Like other customers, I waited almost a month to get these. Looks like they were shipped from Malaysia, so it's understandable that they took awhile to get to me. They came in a nice little box, looked just like the picture, very pretty. They fit great, I was happy! I put the pink one in right away and wore it for TWO WHOLE DAYS before the stone on the bottom ball fell out. I mean, I knew they'd be cheap, but I didn't think they'd be THAT cheap. We'll see how long the other three last. I'm disappointed to say the least.
