I thought this was expensive for the size. I compared Domino sugar to my local grocery store brand sugar and it was pretty much the same. The container is OK as an alternative to the bags you buy at the grocery store that always spill when opening. I would usually transfer the sugar from those paper bags to a ziploc bag for storage. I will use this container for future purchases of sugar from my local store, just cause that sugar is alot cheaper.
