Always good to have a compilation of Shakespeare on hand -- but this particular edition doesn't really work well on a Kindle. Don't get me wrong -- it is, indeed complete, just no footnotes or line numbers and other kinds of annotations you'd expect to come with reading Shakespeare. Haven't seen this book in a hard copy, but I don't recommend it for Kindle.
