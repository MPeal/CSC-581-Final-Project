Everything about the backpack is good except that there is a hard plastic board in the back. It is probably put in for stability and for the flex vent system to contour to your back. However, this makes the backpack extremely stiff, and also prevents the backpack from standing up on its own, you will have to lean it against something.The back flex vent system is also very scratchy and abrasive, not only is it uncomfortable when it comes in contact with your skin, it also causes any t-shirt I wear that is not 100% cotton to pill on the lower back/butt area. I've already ruined 2 nice t-shirts wearing this backpack. I have used this for a total of 6 weeks or 1 summer semester.. but will probably sell this backpack on ebay, as it is passed the return date, and use the money to buy a new backpack for the fall. Besides these two large negatives for me its a great backpack, waterproof, good laptop sleeve, compartments, etc. However, if these two negatives are issues for you too, buy a different backpack.
