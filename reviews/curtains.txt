This blackout curtain panel works great when the afternoon sun is glaring through our window and blinding me. Its pattern is modern and attractive, and the steel rings slide easily along my curtain rod. The length is perfect. The curtain is thick and offers an insulating factor that helps keep my room warm in the winter and blocks out the sun to help keep it cool in the summer.
