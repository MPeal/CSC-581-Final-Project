I have attempted to reach out to the company that sold me this item. The company send me a generic email that said "will get back to you" I haven't heard from them since and it's been two weeks very upset with this product, is poorly made, it over heats on the lowest temperature and it doesn't cool off unless you unplug the machine. I can only do five waffle cones at a time before it starts overheating and burning waffle cones. The nonstick surface is nonexistent. I have followed the manual for cleaning and use and it still has malfunctioned. I paid $278.00 for this. I will absolutely tell all my customers and other companies I deal with that this product is a horrible item and the customer service is even worse. Please feel free to email me with questions.
