I got this to give in a family White Elephant gift exchange. 
My family southern and pretty religious so I thought this would make a good/funny gift. 
I put it in a box along with some scratch off lottery tickets. 
I was so excited for someone to open it and finally someone did, and it was my grandmother. 
I wish more people had seen it and her reaction but so much was going on that only a couple people saw her open it. 
Anyway, she opened it and with a confused look on her face said, "it's Jesus" and then put it away. LOL
My only complaint is the quality. 
I didn't take it out of the box since it was a gift, but the inside of the box was dirty and Jesus seemed to have some paint that had worn. 
Not a big deal in my situation. The lottery tickets were the real gift.
