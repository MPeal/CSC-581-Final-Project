I'm a 12 handicap player that unfortunately only plays once or twice a week.. Was looking for the "best" product to help make distance easy, and accurate. Originally looked at laser devices and was one click away when I decided GPS would maybe be a better fit for me, as I have a hard time holding my friends still, and sometimes would shoot the wrong thing giving me a bogus distance. Long story short, I still didn't like the idea of needing to bring something out of my bag, cart or have in my pocket and gave this S a chance.. This thing is the best purchase I have EVER made for golf.. Hands down, the easiest, most accurate device you can imagine.. It is instant.. And dead on.. Just went on a golf trip playing several different courses for the first time and this helped me tremendously. All my other buddies have the laser or GPS wouldn't even go to their bag anymore. They were constantly asking me.. No problem, I just turned my wrist over and it was there.. It's without a doubt a MUST by for any avid golfer.. Can't speak highly enough about it.. Now you may want to purchase the cheaper version without all the bells and whistles and I'm sure it would be just fine. I used the email and text function just to see that it worked, but didn't want that to always be coming across while I'm playing.. I did however use it for the drive home. Pretty cool really.. Anyway, don't read another review.. If you can afford this watch. Buy it! If you can't and just need basic distance, buy one of the cheaper versions.. But if you do buy this, you will be very pleased.. I don't normally review things, but want to let the world know how great this is.. By the way, we played 36 holes per day and I had it running 100 percent of the time.. No screen saver.. Never a problem with battery. Checked out the distance from plates on course and friends laser and it was spot on.. I mean dead on.. No problems, no worries, easy out of the box ... It works.. Buy it.
