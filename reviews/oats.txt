I didn't even get through an ounce of groats before it stopped cranking. 

When I emptied out the hopper to see what was going wrong, I heard metal clanking. 

I opened up the device by removing two screws and found I had broken a gear. 

Not sure how groats were stronger than metal, but clearly the gears are not made of strong enough stuff.
