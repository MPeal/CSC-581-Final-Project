I ordered "passion play" based on the color shown online and i was so beyond disappointed when I opened the package to find a bright orange lipstick. There is absolutely no resemblance between the color shown for sale and the color I got. this was my 1st purchase from Gerard cosmetics and I was excited for the "pink brown" that I was hoping for. Don't trust the color samples shown I guess....
