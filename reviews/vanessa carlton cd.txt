This disc has great songs on it, but they are recorded in a very poor manner. You can actually hear the microphone input clip on parts of certain songs. This is solely the fault of the recording engineer. In other parts you begin to wonder if the other instruments are the feature and not Vanessa.

If you are listening to this CD on a boombox or some HTIB system, you may not ba able to hear what I hear (I have Classe front end components pushing B&W 802D speakers.) When I purchase a CD I expect recording quality better than what I can do in my basement!
