These socks are a perfect weight, they provide 20-30 mmHg medically certified firm but comfortable compression and the foot beds have just the right amount of cushioning with flat seams in the toe that are so comfortable. Best of all, they are rather stylish and don't look like the old standard white or beige compression socks.
