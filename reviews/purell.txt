IMO, Purell is the absolute best hand sanitizer. Simple. Perfect consistency. Moisturizes, but not too much. Fragrance free. With both children and elderly people in our home, none of whom are very hygienic, these big bottles are perfect. Convincing the kids and old folks to use a squirt of Purell has been much more successful than getting them to actually wash their hands. I keep a bottle in every room and also use them to refill our smaller travel bottles. I also have a bottle at work, where we deal with clients of sometimes suspect cleanliness and their money, which is, of course, filthy. I've been ordering this from Amazon for quite some time. As others have said, do NOT depend on the "handle" to carry the bottles, and whoever packs and/or ships obviously doesn't understand what "This End Up" means. Fortunately, the packaging is secure enough to keep the bottles safe.
