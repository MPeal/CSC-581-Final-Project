Far smaller than expected. Listing indicates the dimensions are 2.31 x 2.88 x 4.75 in. I incorrectly believed that this was the dimension per ice pack rather than for the box that they come in. Since there are three ice packs, you can see that these are less than an inch thick, about the length and width of a deck of cards. Even with three of these placed into an insulated lunch bag, they fail to keep even a single small sandwich cool for 5 hours.
