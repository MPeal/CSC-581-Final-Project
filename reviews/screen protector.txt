Horrible!!! This screen protector is very small and does not fit the whole front of the phone like it is supposed too! It doesn't even cover the phones screen! It also sticks out and is very thick which irritates me very much! I ordered the "privacy screen" which does not even work! When you turn the phone to the side, you can still see everything on the screen, but it looks like the brightness is turned down! Also, when I went to get the bubbles out, the card they gave me to do so scratched and put dents in my screen protector!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL!
