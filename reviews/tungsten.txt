I decided to upgrade my wedding band and get something that was durable, yet still stylish. After some searching I found this beauty...and for one heck of a price! I checked out the reviews, did some quick research and ordered it. I've had it almost 6 months now and I love it! I got a size 7 since it's a mens ring and well...I am not so my hands are smaller. It fits perfect on my finger and looks great!! I couldn't be happier with this ring!!!
