This game is way too damn hard. I don't usually do reviews on games, but I was looking forward to getting this because there's not a lot of games on the Seitch right now. I was disappointed. I love the fighting system, I love the random map changes and enemy counters, but I can't ever progress. If you die, even one of your heroes dies, that's it. You get sent back to the beginning, losing everything. I haven't even gained another hero yet, and I've been playing games all my life. There's a fun game behind the frustration of never progressing, but I'm not going to be playing this game anymore. I bought the downloadable version, kind of wish I had laid off and not bought it.
