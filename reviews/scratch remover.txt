As several others have stated, the sandpaper, despite the fine grade, can ruin the clear coat - and it still doesn't even fix the scratch! I know have several dull areas (with sort-of concealed scratches) on the two passenger doors now. I have tried polishing and waxing with other products but to no avail. Very disappointed and would NOT recommend buying this kit.
