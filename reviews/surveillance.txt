I love this Funlux camera, its AWESOME!! 
For the price and what you get, you can't get much better! 
The sound is great, you can talk and hear whats' going on, you get notifications on your cell phone if sound or movement is detected and the picture is so clear. It's color during the day and black and white at night. The viewing area is great too. it covers a big area for such a small camera. I'm currently using it to watch my furbaby during the day. He doesn't ever get into any trouble, he just sleeps all day, but it's nice to have the satisfaction of being able to check on him throughout the day and make sure he's ok. You can watch from a computer or cell phone from MeShare.com. At work I minimize the picture on my desktop and can keep an eye on him all day, And another nice plus is, on my cellphone I can zone in real close, which would be good if you need some kind of detail on something. It shows in HD too. And the setup was unbelievably easy and I'm NOT a tech person. It took me about 5 min to set it all up including hooking up to the Wi-Fi network. The only thing I don't like about it is the cord has to be plugged into the camera and it's not a very long cord and I have it on a dresser which every time I walk by the camera moves because it's so small and light, so I have to keep fixing it to the right angle. I hate to be picky, but I wish it was cordless too! I guess nothing is PERFECT. But overall, I think if you get this, you will NOT be disappointed especially for this price and the shipping was super fast too!!
