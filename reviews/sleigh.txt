The quality of the item is very poor, even though it was cheap price wise - I expected something better. The screws were all coming out and the front piece was hanging off. The finish is a very poor replica of something vintage and more tacky than anything. All together very disappointed and not worth the hassle of soaking up the cost to return the item. Do not recommend this product. It was shipped in a timely manner.
