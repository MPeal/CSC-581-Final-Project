Like the 3 stars say, It's OK. Plan on a good hour assembling it and, you need to do it once it is mounted on the ceiling or, it will be almost impossible to mount after. Spent 45 minutes on a ladder looping teeny tiny wire rings, one by one, through teeny tiny little holes to attach the crystals. Instructions are just a drawing, so it was hit or miss what order to assemble. After it is up, it looks attractive and adds a lot of style to a closet for little money. I wouldn't go through the effort again, though
