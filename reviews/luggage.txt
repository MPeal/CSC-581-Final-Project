Bag is amazing out of box. 

However, once I reached my first destination, it all went downhill. 

Bag was ripped upon first destination, piping/edging frayed upon second destination, broken zipper on third destination. 

Think twice about lightweight....try a clamshell/ABS instead. 

This is absolute garbage.
