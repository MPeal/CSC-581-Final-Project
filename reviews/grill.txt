I purchased this grill 2 years ago. It is clearly made to be used on the occasional camping trip rather than once or twice a week throughout the year. I was cramped for space on my condo deck and the size of this grill was ideal. I purchased it and loved it. Instant set up and the shelves slide under for a smaller footprint. But, my using it every week for the last 2 years has destroyed it. The bottom has rusted away. Maybe this is all I should have expected; 2 years of use. But it seemed so well built that I honestly thought I would get more use out of it. Disappointing.
