The emphasis in these natural food recipes is to correct an over-active immune system and the evidence is very strong that unprocessed food is one of the main keys to restoring health and wellbeing. 
I recommend this book because the author has followed the strictest principles of intelligent nutrition whilst offering a very broad range of dishes to tempt the palate and reward the reader with an unfailing supply of great dishes. 
Not an easy task to accomplish but perfectly delivered throughout the book. We consider wholesome food as the best medicine and that principle fully applies to correcting auto-immune problems. It is a beautiful and elegant book of natural healing.
