Unfortunately, is not what I expected. The sandwich has to be really soft so that you can cut it. I used it a few times and tried to make different sandwiches before I gave up.
The only shape that I could create without ruin in was peanut butter and jelly.
I bought it for the price and for the fun shapes but I should have spent few more bucks to get the steel ones
