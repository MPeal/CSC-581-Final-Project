Just got this in today and it seems to be working fine. Like the remote control feature. One thing that I noticed, it makes a high pitched hum while thermostat is cycling. It stops for awhile and when it starts warming back up again it makes the same hum again. It's not loud but annoying.It may be this particular heater. Don't know if all the Pelonis heaters do this. But I'm not going to send it back just to find out that all their heaters have this problem.
