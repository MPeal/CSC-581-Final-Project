Love this detergent! 

I switched to it after a lengthy series of changes to my washing/drying habits. 

I was having an issue with smelly towels and tried a ton of things to fix it. (Read my reviews of Smelly Towel Cleaner and Smelly Washer Cleaner if you're having that problem.) 

Anyway, part of the solution was moving to ERA. This doesn't seem to leave a residue in my front load washing machine, meaning it washes clean and doesn't leave lingering odors. 

My clothes smell fresh (I don't tend to use dryer sheets unless I'm washing a static-prone load) from this soap, but not overbearing. 

I can't stand Tide, because the perfumes are overwhelming and not pleasant. 

This is exactly what laundry soap should be like. 

Oh, I guess it goes without saying that I feel it cleans my clothes. 

It doesn't mean you won't have to use a stain lifter for special stains, and you may still wish to bleach whites, but it's still a great basic cleaner.
