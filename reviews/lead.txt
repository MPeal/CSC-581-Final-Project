There is not much to say, but Amazon keeps urging me to write a review. 0.5 mm is the most usual pencil so having a supply of lead refills is always good. The usual hardness available in most stores is HB, roughly what is considered No. 2 pencil. Towards softer grades is B, 2B and 3B, so this reviewed grade is pretty soft. But it makes it easier to write in distinct black. HB used in a sleeve 0.5 mm pencil is effectively fainter than No. 2 pencil because of the lower pressure in writing one would normally use. My preferred grade is 2B. I got the 3B because it was at that time much cheaper than any other grade. It writes well, it wears off quickly, but it does not seem to break more than others.
If you like(d) Pentel products, stock up on them. From what I can tell, this type of a trapezoid package is being discontinued and the pencils are also becoming scarce. They may not be in demand. Our university bookstore is not restocking Pentel leads in the once every present display case anymore.
