Okay, here's a funny story. Scary even. I live in Mongolia and I ordered the Fender Champion 100 from Amazon US. It arrived safely. I rushed home and quickly opened it up and quickly plugged into my socket. The lights came on for 2 seconds and then they went out. No power. I tried plugging it into a different socket several times but to no avail. THEN I realised that this is an American product and requires 110 volts. Mongolia uses 220 volts. To my horrid realisation, I had blown it up within 2 seconds of opening it. I got it fixed and I even bought a 110v to 220v transformer. Now it works perfectly.

I did a lot of research (about 3 months' research) into what amp I should get. Then I chose the Fender Champion 100. Of all the amps I have used throughout my life, this is the one I am most satisfied with. Firstly because it's solid state, it's very light unlike those tube amps. Secondly and more importantly, it has all these wonderful voices and FX you can choose from. Champion 100 delivers on all the sounds you want. Full stop. Thirdly, it comes with its own footswitch, which is excellent.
