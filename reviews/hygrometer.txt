Temp & humidity readings seem accurate but otherwise device is substantially smaller than I had imagined. 
I utilize for measurement of relative humidity of my home during the wintertime. 
Maintaining humidity above 50% reduces the desire to raise HVAC thermostat temp and cuts my electric bill by at least 30%. 
I only wish I'd paid more attention to the physical screen size. 
I can't read it ten feet away. 
This unit is probably better suited for hydroponics or a small green house, not for what I'd purchased it for.
