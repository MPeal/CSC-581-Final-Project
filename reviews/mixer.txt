Everyone should have a KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer. It's durable, multi purpose and attractive. This mixer is everything you and I will ever need. I bought this as a wedding gift for myself and my husband. Everything I've made has come out perfect. I bought the Artisan over the regular stand mixer because the Artisan came with a splash guard. The best part are the attachments. I have only bought so far the ice cream bowl mixer and love it, I've made chunky monkey ice cream, chocolate ice cream and raspberry sorbet. When cleaning the mixer, you don't want to use cleaners on it, just a wet sponge to wipe it down with some soap. The best part about this mixer is the fact it comes in so many different colors, I bought it in Enpire Red. Don't hesitate to buy this, definitely buy this product, you won't be disappointed.
