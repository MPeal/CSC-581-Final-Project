I am 36 years old and I have cystic adult acne. I typically use Obagi products but they are to strong to used during pregnancy. I switched to this product which made me break out more than ever. I didn't get that pregnancy glow my first trimester but instead just awful breakouts. I tried a few other things but eventually switched to Cetaphil and after a few weeks my skin cleared up and I have had mostly clear skin through my second and third trimester. Cetaphil has been a life saver!!!! I can't believe it's taken me 36 years to finally give it a chance
