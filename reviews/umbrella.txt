The color bleeds a bit when wet and it rains a lot where I live. It opens and closes easily. The tilting mechanism is poorly designed, and is very difficult to grasp. It is a textured metal piece that slides in a groove, but has nothing to grab onto. The mechanism is stiff, so it is very hard to slide with just your thumb. If you will frequently use the tilt, I wouldn't recommend this item. After a year, no tears or other problems
