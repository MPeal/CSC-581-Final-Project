This arrived promptly and without damage. If you have never used Two Old Goats, you really should try it. It is great for sore muscles and aches caused by Arthritis. I use it on my hands, and I get relief within 15 minutes. I am not crazy about the fragrance of it, but it dissipates quickly and is worth putting up with it for the good results.
