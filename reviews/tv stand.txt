Shipping was fast and the package was in great shape! I was excited and couldn't wait to start putting this together. I opened the box and noticed everything was labeled which was really great!!! The parts are
(2 A's) (2 B's) (2 C's) (2 D's) (8 E's) (4 F's) (4 G's)(4 H's) (4 I's) and (4 J's).. Just when I got it all together and organized, and ready to put it together I noticed 2 parts of the E's were broken. I was disappointed because the E's go in the front and they hold the shelf in place and it was very noticeable!!! I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning so I decided to use Gorilla Glue and that worked, then proceeded to put it all together. The instructions were very easy to follow. Once all was together I painted the parts where I glued. Now you wouldn't even notice it! I'm giving this 3 Stars because in my opinion the pieces were already broken before shipping. Whoever packed this in the box (factory) place the broken pieces in the middle of the parts so it wouldn't be noticed!!! Over all these are nice and sturdy. I have one on each side of my TV and they look great after my fix!
