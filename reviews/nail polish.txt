I bought this along with two other Finger Paint colors yesterday. 
I just tried Finger Paints two weeks ago and liked the opaqueness of the color and the price, plus it stayed on without chipping longer than the previous brand. 
I used Everglaze prep, FP Tiffany Imposter, and Everglaze Top Coat. 
It all dries so quick without a light, it's amazing how fast you can use your hands without getting your nails dinged. 
I have attached a pic. 
I normally prefer neutral colors - beige, pink, but I thought this would be a fun color.
