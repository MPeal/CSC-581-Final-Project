I purchased this earlier this year, packed up my winter sheets and bedding. I placed it on a shelf where it was undisturbed until I went out to get my flannel bedding. It had nothing on top of it. The bag was still zipped, but the zipper had separated from the plastic leaving several gaps which allowed dust or insects to get in. Totally useless for the purpose for which it is designed. I would not purchase this again and would not recommend it.
