It didn't sprout well for me, which was disappointing. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I treated the millet seeds the same way as all the other sprouts I've successfully sprouted so I don't know what happened. I was hoping I would be able to give my cockatiels sprouted millet for the health benefits it has over non-sprouted millet, but I wasn't able to.
