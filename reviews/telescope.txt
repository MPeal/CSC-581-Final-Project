Very nice spotting scope. 
I was surprised at how well you can see a target at 100 yards. 
The cell phone attachment is super cool too. 
I can point it down range and speak a command to take a picture after every shot so I can review them later in sequence. 
Would definitely recommend this scope for both the quality and the price. 
I did purchase a larger tripod for what I was going to use it for. 
The one that comes with it is fine but is made for table top.
