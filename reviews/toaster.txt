This toaster does it job, the bread is toasted! Woohoo! The longer slots made it so it fit where we wanted it and still can toast four slices.

However, who decided your toaster has to beep?! You depress the lever to put the toast down BEEP. Thank you, since I was the one pushing the lever down, I was in fact aware that I pushed the lever down. Your toast is done BEEP BEEP BEEP then the toast pops up. Ok, here maybe ONE beep I could see. Of course the whole sound of the toast popping up has been my indicator for the past 30 years, but now I also get a BEEP. Mornings sure are stressful with all the beeps around here. BEEP alarm clock. BEEP coffee is done. BEEP toast is started. BEEP microwave is done. BEEP BEEP BEEP toast is done. BEEP alarm system set. BEEP backing out of my garage. Finally - at a beepless work, but wait BEEEEEEEP
