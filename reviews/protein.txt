My life changed in an instant when I was taken down by a hit and run driver 25 years ago. After extensive surgeries on my intestinal tract I recovered and had a fairly normal 15 year run. Now the scar tissue twists my intestines into balloon animals and every bite I take has to be nutritionally dense because I'm able to eat so little.

I am one of those people that eat to stay alive, I don't live to eat...I'm a picky eater. Taste, smells and textures all have to be on the mark or I can't manage it.

Yes, this product is expensive. But as someone who absolutely knows the hydrolized broken down essentially "pre-digested" protein strands in this product result in optimum absorbtion and availability of ALL complete amino acids (used to build proteins) I can tell you I would not be as healthy as I am without it. And I'm in excellent health other than my digestive tract.

I'm a 65yo woman, live alone, off grid in the mountains and have a physically demanding life taking care of my homestead and animals. I move 2-4,000 pounds of food weekly as a volunteer at the local food bank. I'm not sitting on the sofa watching reality tv and knitting booties.

I'm preparing for what I sincerely hope is the last surgery I'll have. I need 80 grams of protein a day. I cannot eat anything that has to be chewed - no meat, cheese, eggs, grains or fiber of any kind, fruit or vegetables. I eat yogurt, pudding and ice cream. Without this product my body would not be able to sustain health let alone be ready for a 10 hour surgery.

If you want minimal results and expensive poop filled with half digested whey make your choice based on price.

If you want your body to have access to nutritionally available complete proteins it can absorb easily THIS is the best.
