They were cute to look at...pretty chewy but okay. Twice the size of a normal gummy. Kids liked them. Unfortunately there were only 53 pieces were in the package advertised to have at least 100! This was not good as I needed at least 60 to give out to classroom children as a treat. I had to cut the last 12 in half so that all the children got a taste
