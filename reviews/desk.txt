The problem lies in the shipping. 
This desk came in the worst packaging shape I have ever received anything in. 
The box had holes everywhere and was missing a tie across the box (3 showing one lcearly gone). 
I had 2 of the drawer tracks come bent, there are only 4 total. 
I had the top piece of the desk come chipped! 
Its in the corner so I colored it in with a permanent marker. 
Assembly wasn't bad at all and the desk like I said is OK. 
Just know you are playing Russian Roulette with the shipping and you are going to have to bend metal pieces and color spots in. 
I wish I took pictures but didn't know you could upload them.
